# Admin-Dashboard

For this project, I will be displaying plenty of new css grid skills I learned over the course. This is be done purely in css grid format. No flexbox will be used. I will be using a lot of new intermediate css skills such as new way of using selectors, using svg pictures, more css properties, positioning, browser compatibility.
